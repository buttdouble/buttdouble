<strong>Spaghetti</strong> aglio e olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. It is a typical dish of Neapolitan cuisine and is widely popular. It’s popularity can be attributed to it being simple to prepare and the fact that it makes use of inexpensive, readily-available ingredients that have long shelf lives in a pantry.

<strong>The</strong> dish is made by first lightly sautéing thinly sliced garlic in olive oil, sometimes with the addition of red pepper flakes (in which case its name is spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino). The oil and garlic are then tossed with spaghetti cooked in salted water. Finely chopped Italian parsley is then commonly added as a garnish. Grated parmesan or pecorino cheese can be added, although cheese is not included in most traditional recipes. Some recipes recommend adding some of the pasta water to the olive oil to create a sauce, but other recipes recommend simply pouring the oil onto the drained pasta, which doesn’t create a sauce.
